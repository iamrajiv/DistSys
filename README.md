## About

The Distributed Systems Visualizer is an educational tool designed to help students, engineers, and anyone interested in distributed systems understand complex concepts through interactive visualizations. The project focuses on making abstract distributed systems principles tangible and easier to comprehend.

## Features

#### Algorithms

- **CAP Theorem Explorer**: Visualize the trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance
- **Consensus Algorithms**: TBD
- **Leader Election**: TBD
- **Distributed Mutual Exclusion**: TBD
- **Gossip Protocols**: TBD
- **Consistent Hashing**: TBD

## Usage

The application is organized into different sections, each focusing on a specific distributed systems concept.

1. **CAP Theorem Explorer**: Experiment with different system configurations to understand how they handle network partitions.
2. **Consensus Algorithms**: TBD
3. **Leader Election**: TBD
4. **Mutual Exclusion**: TBD
5. **Gossip Protocols**: TBD
6. **Consistent Hashing**: TBD

Each visualization includes interactive controls to adjust parameters and observe the effects on the system.
