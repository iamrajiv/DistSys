## About

The Distributed Systems Visualizer is an educational tool designed to help students, engineers, and anyone interested in distributed systems understand complex concepts through interactive visualizations. The project focuses on making abstract distributed systems principles tangible and easier to comprehend.

## Features

#### Algorithms

- **CAP Theorem Explorer**: Visualize the trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Interactive demonstrations of Raft and Paxos consensus protocols
- **Leader Election**: Visualize how distributed systems elect leaders
- **Distributed Mutual Exclusion**: Understand how systems coordinate access to shared resources
- **Gossip Protocols**: See how information propagates through a distributed network
- **Consistent Hashing**: Learn how data is distributed across nodes in a scalable way

## Usage

The application is organized into different sections, each focusing on a specific distributed systems concept:

1. **CAP Theorem Explorer**: Experiment with different system configurations to understand how they handle network partitions.
2. **Consensus Algorithms**: Visualize how nodes in a distributed system reach agreement.
3. **Leader Election**: See how distributed systems elect coordinator nodes.
4. **Mutual Exclusion**: Learn how distributed systems manage access to shared resources.
5. **Gossip Protocols**: Observe how information spreads through a network using epidemic protocols.
6. **Consistent Hashing**: Understand how data distribution works in distributed databases.

Each visualization includes interactive controls to adjust parameters and observe the effects on the system.
